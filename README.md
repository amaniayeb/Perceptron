# Perceptron
Setting up a perceptron with 10 neurons in the hidden layer can be a highly instructive starting point for gaining a fundamental understanding of neural networks. The perceptron represents a basic unit within artificial neural networks, and the introduction of a hidden layer, accompanied by adjustment of the number of neurons, offers the possibility of assimilating more complex representations.
